Let´s think for a bit, in which field are you?
How many female professors did you have during your professional formation? and how many males?
Does the gender matter? or why does this gap between female and male professors exist?

In 1965, an article was posted called "Women in science: why so few?" Would you have guessed that more than 50 years later we are still asking ourselves, "Why are there so few women in science?"

Today, I would like to address the "Factors that contribute to the underrepresentation of women in science careers worldwide". This paper was written by Beatrice Avolio, Jessica Chávez, and Carlos Vílchez‑Román and was published in 2020. In this literature review, the authors identify the factors that affect this underrepresentation of women in science worldwide.

The studies reviewed by the authors focused on specific factors that may affect the presence of women in science, such as the presence of role models, stereotypes about gender roles, work-family, and family-work conflicts, or family environment.

In this post, I will address some of these factors:

Family factors, such as, Stimulation and family support, stereotypes, and household demands.

Stimulation and family support: Studies showed that family encouragement, more so than family background, is one of the factors that predicted women’s persistence in science.

Stereotypes: about science in the family. and gender stereotypes, which include the parents’ beliefs about genders, careers, Stereotypes in the family are an important component that affects women’s choice to pursue a science career.

Household demands: In many cultures, taking care of the children, elderly or disabled persons is an activity delegated entirely to women. In the case of women in science, women resolve the conflicts of family and professional roles by delaying motherhood, abandoning the scientific career, giving up personal time, pursuing more modest and manageable careers, or not having children.

Social factors: characterized by socio-cultural constructions of global and local groups that are transmitted through social relations.

Cultural beliefs about gender and science: The stereotype threat is a social factor defined as the fear caused by the expectation that one will be judged or treated in terms of a negative stereotype of one group.
For example, in Malaysia, there are more women in higher computer science education because this field is not considered “masculine”; on the contrary, it is deemed as providing suitable jobs and good careers for women.

The absence of role models: The existence of science role models seems to influence women’s career choice.

In the review of the editor Jennifer Saunders "Evidence-Based Interventions for Addressing the Underrepresentation of Women in Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine".
It addresses a lot of important topics. If you are interested in getting to know a bit more I really invite you to check it out.

The results showed that the low presence of women in science careers has complex and multi-causal reasons. It seems to be the result of the cumulative effect of several factors throughout the stages of women’s lives, and their context.

Women’s underrepresentation in science is a complex and multicausal problem that needs to be examined under a multicausal and comprehensive approach, taking into account the factors that influence the admission, participation, and progression of women in science.

What do you think is the main factor for the lacking of women in Science and technology?
And most important, what are you doing to change it?
